# Decisions — fgw

Every decision (design and process alike), numbered `DEC-NNN-N`, **newest-first**. Each: `Decision:` /
`Rationale:` (name the alternative that lost) / `Consequences:`. 🔴 IDs are never reused or renumbered;
a superseded decision is **tombstoned, never deleted** (`### DEC-NNN-N — ⛔ superseded by \`DEC-MMM-M\``
and nothing else), so every handle ever issued resolves. Scan `DECISIONS-DIGEST.md` for precedent, then
open the cited entry here. Full format: `reference/CONV-FORMAT.md`.

## Conv 001

### DEC-001-1 — Enforce the A/B question format with a Stop hook, not willpower
**Decision:** A project Stop hook (`.claude/hooks/check-ab-options.sh`, registered in
`.claude/settings.json`) inspects the last assistant turn; if it ends with a `👉👉👉` question but
presents no labelled `A)`/`B)` options, it blocks the stop (exit 2) and feeds the lapse back to be
re-asked. The `👉👉👉` anchor (CLAUDE.md "Interaction model") is the detection handle. Permission asks
count — every `👉👉👉` question must offer labelled options. The hook fails open and has a
`stop_hook_active` loop guard (at most one forced correction).
**Rationale:** The A/B rule already lived in `CLAUDE.md` and was still violated in-conv; "I'll apply
it going forward" is the same judgment that just lapsed, so only a check outside that judgment is
worth anything. Rejected: B) relying on manual enforcement (the trust that already failed).
**Consequences:** New process artifact (weighed against `DEC-000-7` lean-process: small, single-purpose,
self-testing). Takes effect once the session reloads hook config. If the anchor convention changes,
the detection handle changes with it.

## Conv 000 — bootstrap (manual setup, predates the lifecycle)

### DEC-000-7 — Keep the process lean by policy
**Decision:** The conv/documentation methodology is kept deliberately lean. Prune `CLAUDE.md` past
~120 lines; treat the documentation apparatus as a cost; verify in the running product, not just in
tests; a green check is not proof.
**Rationale:** The sibling projects' scars: SPT cut its `CLAUDE.md` 96% (1,009→41 lines) after it
over-grew, and in one stretch its harness out-committed its product 22:2; Peerloop shipped a silent
14% icon shrink because a page was never live-verified. The method should practice what the new site
preaches. Rejected: porting fps's full ~150-line rule set and five-skill surface verbatim.
**Consequences:** Skills and `CLAUDE.md` are trimmed adaptations, not copies; `r-vocab` and the
vault/sensitive/MCP machinery were dropped; `dep-check`/`dist-check` deferred until `fgw-26` exists.

### DEC-000-6 — Site thesis: judgment over commoditized code
**Decision:** The new frasergorrie.com positions Fraser as the "route planner and helmsman" whose
44 years of judgment steer AI-driven development — understanding client needs and knowing when a
solution will actually work. It retires the legacy site's "NoCode-First for everything" framing and
updates "40 years" to 44.
**Rationale:** In the AI age, writing code is commoditized; judgment is not. The evidence base
(`discovery/`) supports the judgment thesis far better than a capabilities list. Rejected: carrying
forward the NoCode-strategist positioning (dated, and undersells the differentiator).
**Consequences:** Site copy is built from the `EVIDENCE-LEDGER.md` proof-points; messaging must avoid
reading as "not technical." Style/theme to be decided separately (marketing site, broad appeal).

### DEC-000-5 — Full decisions + learnings + generated digest from day one
**Decision:** `DECISIONS.md` (numbered, tombstoned), per-conv learnings records (`docs/convs/`), and
the generated `DECISIONS-DIGEST.md` are all set up from the start — not deferred until the record is
large.
**Rationale:** Going back into the decision record to chart local choices is where both parties
benefit; the digest is how that scan stays cheap as the record grows. Rejected (my initial
recommendation): defer the digest until the record is big — the user wants the mechanism in place from
conv one.
**Consequences:** `gen-decisions-digest.sh` ported and run from Conv 000; `/r-end` regenerates the
digest whenever `DECISIONS.md` changes.

### DEC-000-4 — Single-file task board to start
**Decision:** The board is one file, `CURRENT-TASKS.md`, with sections 🔥 Ordered / 📋 Unordered /
⏸️ Parked / ✅ Completed this conv.
**Rationale:** A new, small project does not need fps's two-file Ordered/Unordered split; lean first.
Rejected: fps's `CURRENT-TASKS.md` + `UNORDERED-TASKS.md` split.
**Consequences:** Split into two files only if the single board demonstrably earns it.

### DEC-000-3 — Conv lifecycle adapted from fps (most current)
**Decision:** The session methodology is adapted from **fps**, the most current of the sibling
lifecycles: skills `r-start` / `r-commit` / `r-end` / `r-hopper`, plus `conv-state.sh` and
`gen-decisions-digest.sh`. Skill names kept as-is.
**Rationale:** fps is the latest iteration of the pattern used across fps/Peerloop/SPT. Keeping the
names avoids needless divergence. Rejected: rebranding the skills; porting from the older
Peerloop/SPT variants.
**Consequences:** `r-vocab` (fps PKM-specific) not ported; vault/sensitive-egress/MCP machinery and
the decile/sweep scaffolding dropped; the global `SessionStart` machine-detection hook is reused.

### DEC-000-2 — Dual-repo control
**Decision:** `fgw-26-docs` is the project home and governs the website code repo `fgw-26`; the
lifecycle commits and pushes both. `frasergorrie` (the legacy site) is read-only reference and is
never committed or pushed by the lifecycle.
**Rationale:** Mirrors the proven `fps-docs`/`fps`, `peerloop-docs`/`Peerloop`, `spt-docs`/`spt`
pattern. Rejected: a single combined repo; treating `fgw-26` as the home.
**Consequences:** `--add-dir ../fgw-26 --add-dir ../frasergorrie` on launch; skills stage by name
across the two owned repos only.

### DEC-000-1 — Tech stack: Astro + Cloudflare Workers + Tailwind v4 (latest)
**Decision:** The website is built on Astro (SSR, Cloudflare adapter) deployed to **Cloudflare
Workers**, with **Tailwind v4** (CSS-first, via `@tailwindcss/vite`), on latest package versions.
**shadcn/ui** is under consideration for styling consistency (React islands + Tailwind + CSS-variable
theming). TypeScript throughout; Vitest; ESLint + Prettier; wrangler exact-pinned.
**Rationale:** Adopts peerloop/SPT's battle-tested stack decisions (Workers over Pages — the adapter
dropped Pages; exact-pin wrangler to dedupe Miniflare). shadcn's copy-in, CSS-variable model suits a
style-guide + theme. Rejected: Cloudflare Pages; the legacy Next.js/Chakra stack; Vercel.
**Consequences:** Marketing site may not need `output: 'server'` (could be mostly static + a Worker
only if a form/endpoint appears); shadcn to be weighed against JS weight during the style discussion.
Concrete versions pinned when `fgw-26` is scaffolded.
