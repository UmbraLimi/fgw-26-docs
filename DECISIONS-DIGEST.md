### DEC-005-1 — The 👉👉👉 trigger covers every answer-expecting question, incl. the end-of-turn "what next?"

Extend the 👉👉👉 rule (`DEC-002-1`) in `CLAUDE.md` §Interaction model: the anchor is
required on *every question expecting an answer — ruling, pick, or aside alike, never a rhetorical one*,
not only on questions I classify as decisions. The A/B rule and the `check-ab-options.sh` Stop hook are
left unchanged.

### DEC-004-7 — `[STYLE-THEME]` component styles (buttons, inputs, cards, prose, nav/footer)

Component layer of the style guide, all driven by the `DEC-004-6` tokens + the new tokens
below. Chosen from rendered in-browser sheets; the `.scratch` mockups are illustrative only — this is
the durable source.
**Buttons** — variants **primary (ink)**, **accent (ember)**, **secondary (outline)**, **ghost**,
**link**. Primary = `--ink` fill + `--paper` text; **ember reserved for the single top conversion CTA +
accents** (not the default). Hover: primary→`--primary-hover`, accent→`--accent-strong`,
secondary/ghost→`--tint-hover`. **Focus = 2px `--accent` ring with 2px offset, site-wide.** Disabled =
45% opacity. Radius `--radius-sm`. In dark, primary inverts (light fill/dark text); accent text uses
`--on-accent`.
**Inputs (boxed)** — `--surface` bg, 1px `--line`, `--radius-sm`, 16px text, placeholder `--faint`;
focus = `--accent` border + 3px `--accent-tint` ring; error = `--danger` border + 3px `--danger-tint`
+ message; label Inter 500 / 13px; help & error text 12.5px.
**Cards/surfaces** — `--surface` fill, 1px `--line`, `--radius-md`, **no shadow**; interactive cards
hover → border `--accent` (no lift).
**Prose** — body `--body`/`--muted` at ~62ch; links `--accent` (underline-offset 3px) → `--accent-strong`;
`ul/ol` disc; blockquote left 3px `--accent` rule, `--subtle`, no italics; inline `code` in `--font-mono`
on `--code-bg`; `hr` 1px `--line`.
**Nav/footer** — header `--paper` + hairline underline, Fraunces brand, nav links Inter 14px `--subtle`
→ hover/active `--accent`; footer `--surface`, columnar, small `--subtle` text.
**Misc** — breakpoints Tailwind defaults (640/768/1024/1280); motion 150ms ease on hover/focus + Astro
View Transitions (subtle cross-fade), all behind `prefers-reduced-motion`.
**New tokens (light values; dark mirrors per `DEC-004-6`):** `--on-accent #fff` · `--primary-hover
#332e27` · `--tint-hover #f1ece3` · `--danger #b4231a` · `--danger-tint #fbeceb` · `--radius-sm 4px` ·
`--radius-md 8px` · `--radius-lg 12px` · `--font-mono "JetBrains Mono",ui-monospace,…` · `--code-bg
#f0ebe2`. Dark values for `--on-accent #1b1712` · `--primary-hover #e4ddd0` · `--tint-hover #2b251d`;
dark `--danger*`/`--code-bg` to be set at scaffold.

### DEC-004-6 — `[STYLE-THEME]` concrete token values (fonts, palette, scale)

Finalise the stand-ins from `DEC-004-5` into concrete tokens (all chosen from in-browser
specimens). These are the durable source — the `.scratch/style-*.html` mockups are illustrative only.
**Fonts:** headings **Fraunces** (variable, optical-size, weight 500); body/UI **Inter** (400/500/600).
No mono in the theme (add only if a later need appears).
**Palette (CSS-variable tokens) — light:** `--paper #faf7f2` · `--surface #fffdf9` · `--ink #1c1a17` ·
`--muted #44403a` · `--subtle #6b6459` · `--faint #9a9087` · `--line #e7e1d8` · `--accent #b45309` ·
`--accent-strong #92400e` · `--accent-tint #f6ead9`.
**Palette — dark:** `--paper #1b1712` · `--surface #241f18` · `--ink #f3eee5` · `--muted #cabfb0` ·
`--subtle #9a8f80` · `--faint #6f6557` · `--line #342e25` · `--accent #f0a53f` ·
`--accent-strong #f6b85e` · `--accent-tint #2a2114`. Accent derived from the legacy amber `#ffae1a`
(deepened for light, lifted for dark).
**Type scale (base 16px):** `--display clamp(2.75rem,5vw,3.75rem)` lh 1.08, -0.01em ·
`--h2 clamp(2rem,3.5vw,2.5rem)` lh 1.12, -0.005em · `--h3 1.6rem` lh 1.2 · `--h4 1.3rem` lh 1.3 ·
`--lede 1.25rem` lh 1.6 · `--body 1.0625rem` lh 1.65 (~42ch measure) · `--small 0.875rem` ·
`--eyebrow 0.75rem` +0.14em uppercase (Inter 600). All headings Fraunces 500.
**Spacing:** adopt Tailwind v4's default 0.25rem scale; section rhythm token `clamp(4rem,8vw,8rem)`.

### DEC-004-5 — Visual direction: "quiet authority / editorial craft"

fgw-26's visual personality is **direction A — quiet authority / editorial craft**:
- **Editorial serif headings** + **clean humanist sans body** (Fraunces / Inter shown as stand-ins).
- **Warm neutral palette** — off-white "paper" ground + near-black ink + **one disciplined accent**, an
  ember/ochre that **evolves the legacy amber** (`#ffae1a`) rather than discarding it (continuity +
  seniority).
- Generous type scale, roomy spacing, legibility-as-aesthetic (mirrors the honesty frame).
- **Light and dark both first-class**, via Tailwind v4 CSS-variable tokens (`DEC-004-3`).
- Exact font families, colour ramp, type scale and spacing are **not yet fixed** — the fonts/hexes in
  the Conv 004 mockup (`.scratch/style-directions.html`) are illustrative stand-ins; finalising them is
  the next `[STYLE-THEME]` step.

### DEC-004-4 — Claude runs `/r-commit` autonomously on its own judgment

Claude may run `/r-commit` **without asking**, on its own judgment, whenever meaningful
and relatively self-contained work has been completed. (`/r-commit` was already a standing right in
`CLAUDE.md`; this grants autonomous *timing* — no per-commit approval.) `/r-end` still needs explicit
approval and remains the only operation that pushes.

### DEC-004-3 — Do not adopt shadcn/ui; Tailwind v4 CSS-first theming instead

Resolve `DEC-000-1`'s open "shadcn under consideration" clause **against adoption**. The
token/theming layer is **Tailwind v4 CSS-first `@theme`** (CSS-variable tokens) directly. The few
interactive pieces (mobile nav; optional theme toggle, image lightbox, contact form) are built as
**CSS-only or tiny vanilla/React islands**. shadcn is deferred to a **per-component, island-scoped
trigger**: pull in a *single* shadcn component only if/when a genuinely complex interactive component
appears, and then only that one.

### DEC-004-2 — fgw-26 launch information architecture (page set + scope)

The launch site is these routes (multi-page, per `DEC-004-1` as amended below):
- **`/`** — home: hero (the "I steer; AI drives — and I know when to overrule it" helmsman thesis), the
  "sustained partnerships, not a portfolio grid" reframe, condensed proof-points, work teasers, a
  testimonial, and the contact CTA.
- **`/work`** — a rich index of **summary cards** (problem → outcome → proof), each **single-sourced**
  from its case's own excerpt; plus **`/work/<slug>`** detail pages where the full case text lives
  **once**. (Resolves A/B "both": rich index + detail pages, no full-text duplication.)
- **`/method`** — the working method + honesty/verification frame (from `WORKING-METHOD.md`); the key
  differentiator, successor to legacy `how-i-work`.
- **`/about`** — bio, 44 years, longevity, repositioning-as-adaptability.
- **`/contact`** — the **sole** conversion surface: email CTA, no checkout.

Scope calls: **(1) Commerce dropped** — no Stripe; the legacy SKU / `_agreement` / `-purchase-thanks`
pages are retired; this is a positioning/lead-gen site. **(2) Blog/podcast deferred from launch but
planned-for** — reserve the `/blog` route and stand up the Astro content-collection pattern at scaffold
so a blog is an *additive* insertion later, not a restructure; it is not surfaced in nav or launched
now. **(3) `/spa` reservation abandoned** — amends `DEC-004-1`.

### DEC-004-1 — Site structure: multi-page primary + reserved `/spa` long-scroll view

fgw-26 is a **multi-page site** as its primary structure — real Astro routes
(`/`, plus topic pages), with View Transitions (`<ClientRouter>`) for SPA-smooth navigation where it
helps. Build each content block as a **single-sourced Astro section component**, so routes compose
subsets of a shared component library. **Reserve a `/spa` route** that assembles all sections into one
long-scroll page — a *secondary view of the same source*, not a separate build. `/spa` earns its keep
only if a real job emerges (read-it-all-on-one-page / print-friendly / single-link-to-share); if none
does it can be dropped with zero content loss, and if single-page later wins outright its content is
promoted to `/`.

### DEC-003-2 — fgw-26 testing strategy (all layers)

Adopt one testing strategy across layers, most infra standing up at `[SITE-SCAFFOLD]`:
- **Unit/integration:** Vitest, co-located `*.test.ts`, kept thin (a marketing site has little logic).
  Add a `better-sqlite3`-as-D1 in-memory helper (Peerloop/fps pattern) **only if/when** the site reads
  or writes D1 — not before.
- **UI/component:** React Testing Library on Vitest/jsdom, testing the **interactive React islands
  only** (static Astro markup is eyeballed via the bridge, not unit-tested). If `[STYLE-THEME]` picks
  shadcn/ui, lift fps's `vitest.setup.ts` jsdom-hardening (Radix `ResizeObserver`/`matchMedia`/
  pointer-capture) wholesale.
- **Browser/e2e:** `/chrome` bridge is the live tool (ad hoc). PLATO deferred (`DEC-003-1`); Playwright
  deferred until real flows exist and then kept to a tiny genuinely-gating set (not left to rot as
  Peerloop's did).
- **Harness CLI/scripts:** hand-rolled POSIX `sh`/bash harnesses + a `test-harness.sh` aggregator;
  **mutation-check the guards** — each guard test names, in a comment, the deliberate break it must
  catch, verified to fail on it.
- **Gates/CI:** npm `verify` = lint + typecheck (`tsc --noEmit`) + test + build as the commit-safety
  command; **ESLint (flat) + Prettier** for `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` + `react-hooks`; GitHub Actions
  deferred to `[SITE-SCAFFOLD]`/deploy; no TZ-matrix.
- **Discipline:** keep the `[checked:]` tags + re-run-baseline-this-conv rule (`DEC-000-7`); treat the
  bridge-rendered DOM as ground truth (Peerloop's "only a DOM check exposed the empty feeds" lesson).

### DEC-003-1 — Defer PLATO for fgw-26; document the adoption playbook

Do not build a PLATO-style journey runner for fgw-26 now. Start browser/UI testing with
Vitest + React Testing Library on jsdom for components, and the `/chrome` bridge used ad hoc for visual
checks. Capture the full "what PLATO is / when to adopt / how to adopt" playbook in `_cc/PLATO.md` so
the deferral is revisitable. Browser testing still models on Peerloop's quadrant division of labour
(unit/API → PLATO → bridge-scripted UI walk → sparse Playwright) — only the PLATO layer is deferred.

### DEC-002-1 — A/B Stop guard: read `last_assistant_message`, assess only the ask block

`check-ab-options.sh` no longer parses the transcript. It reads the turn text from the
`last_assistant_message` field CC passes to the Stop hook, isolates the **ask** — everything after the
*last* `👉👉👉` anchor (`${text##*"$anchor"}`) — and requires both an `A)` and a `B)` label within that
block. A durable 15-case test suite (`.claude/hooks/check-ab-options.test.sh`) covers the behaviour.
DEC-001-1's decision (enforce A/B via a Stop hook) still stands; only the mechanism changes — this is
not a supersession.

### DEC-001-2 — Capture the operator's turns verbatim via a UserPromptSubmit hook

A `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`.claude/hooks/capture-turn.sh`) appends each operator prompt
verbatim as one JSON line to the untracked `.conv-turns.jsonl`; `/r-end` renders those into a per-conv
dialogue companion (`docs/convs/.../Conv NNN — dialogue.md`, specced in `reference/CONV-FORMAT.md`) and
deletes the `.jsonl`. The hook gates on `.conv-current`, writes only to files (never stdout — a
UserPromptSubmit hook's stdout enters context), and fails open.

### DEC-001-1 — Enforce the A/B question format with a Stop hook, not willpower

A project Stop hook (`.claude/hooks/check-ab-options.sh`, registered in
`.claude/settings.json`) inspects the last assistant turn; if it ends with a `👉👉👉` question but
presents no labelled `A)`/`B)` options, it blocks the stop (exit 2) and feeds the lapse back to be
re-asked. The `👉👉👉` anchor (CLAUDE.md "Interaction model") is the detection handle. Permission asks
count — every `👉👉👉` question must offer labelled options. The hook fails open and has a
`stop_hook_active` loop guard (at most one forced correction).

### DEC-000-7 — Keep the process lean by policy

The conv/documentation methodology is kept deliberately lean. Prune `CLAUDE.md` past
~120 lines; treat the documentation apparatus as a cost; verify in the running product, not just in
tests; a green check is not proof.

### DEC-000-6 — Site thesis: judgment over commoditized code

The new frasergorrie.com positions Fraser as the "route planner and helmsman" whose
44 years of judgment steer AI-driven development — understanding client needs and knowing when a
solution will actually work. It retires the legacy site's "NoCode-First for everything" framing and
updates "40 years" to 44.

### DEC-000-5 — Full decisions + learnings + generated digest from day one

`DECISIONS.md` (numbered, tombstoned), per-conv learnings records (`docs/convs/`), and
the generated `DECISIONS-DIGEST.md` are all set up from the start — not deferred until the record is
large.

### DEC-000-4 — Single-file task board to start

The board is one file, `CURRENT-TASKS.md`, with sections 🔥 Ordered / 📋 Unordered /
⏸️ Parked / ✅ Completed this conv.

### DEC-000-3 — Conv lifecycle adapted from fps (most current)

The session methodology is adapted from **fps**, the most current of the sibling
lifecycles: skills `r-start` / `r-commit` / `r-end` / `r-hopper`, plus `conv-state.sh` and
`gen-decisions-digest.sh`. Skill names kept as-is.

### DEC-000-2 — Dual-repo control

`fgw-26-docs` is the project home and governs the website code repo `fgw-26`; the
lifecycle commits and pushes both. `frasergorrie` (the legacy site) is read-only reference and is
never committed or pushed by the lifecycle.

### DEC-000-1 — Tech stack: Astro + Cloudflare Workers + Tailwind v4 (latest)

The website is built on Astro (SSR, Cloudflare adapter) deployed to **Cloudflare
Workers**, with **Tailwind v4** (CSS-first, via `@tailwindcss/vite`), on latest package versions.
**shadcn/ui** is under consideration for styling consistency (React islands + Tailwind + CSS-variable
theming). TypeScript throughout; Vitest; ESLint + Prettier; wrangler exact-pinned.
